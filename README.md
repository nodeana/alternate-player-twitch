# Alternate Player for Twitch.tv

A Chrome/Chromium browser extension that replaces the native Twitch player with a custom HLS-based player, giving you full control over buffering, stream quality, chat layout, and playback.

## Background

This project is based on the original **Alternate Player for Twitch.tv** extension. After Chrome and Chromium migrated to **Manifest V3**, the original extension stopped working. MV3 introduced breaking changes to the extension APIs, particularly around request header modification (replacing `webRequest` with `declarativeNetRequest`) and content security policy restrictions that blocked inline script injection.

I found the original source code online and took over maintenance, updating the extension to be fully MV3-compatible and restoring functionality that had broken during the transition.

## What it does

When you visit a Twitch channel page, the extension detects whether the channel is live and redirects you to its own player page instead of the standard Twitch player. This player:

- Fetches the HLS stream directly from Twitch's CDN
- Lets you pick your stream quality and variant manually
- Gives you detailed buffering and playback statistics
- Integrates Twitch chat with configurable layout options
- Supports auto-redirect, which can be toggled by right-clicking the extension button in the nav bar

## Features

- **Custom HLS player**: direct stream fetching with configurable buffering presets, including start playback threshold, buffer size, and concurrent segment downloads
- **Chat integration**: floating or panel chat with configurable position, size, and behaviour; links open in new tabs
- **FFZ (FrankerFaceZ) support**: automatically injects FFZ into the chat frame when the FFZ extension is installed
- **BTTV (BetterTTV) support**: works via FFZ's ffzap-bttv addon when both are installed, avoiding double-injection conflicts
- **Theming**: multiple built-in colour presets for the player UI
- **Statistics overlay**: detailed real-time stats including video/audio codec, bitrate, segment info, buffer health, stream delay, and dropped frames
- **Settings import/export**: save and restore your configuration
- **Auto-redirect toggle**: right-click the HTML5 button in the Twitch nav bar to enable or disable auto-redirect per session
- **Mobile Twitch support**: works on `m.twitch.tv` as well

## Installation (developer mode)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository folder

## Layout

`manifest.json` and `_locales/` stay at the repository root (Chrome requires that). The rest is grouped by role:

| Path              | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/background/` | MV3 service worker (BTTV/FFZ injection, watch events)        |
| `src/content/`    | Scripts and CSS injected on twitch.tv                        |
| `src/shared/`     | Shared utilities used by the player page and content scripts |
| `src/player/`     | Player page, HLS worker, WASM, and player UI assets          |
| `src/rules.json`  | declarativeNetRequest rules                                  |
| `assets/`         | Extension icon                                               |
| `sources/`        | WASM text source (`wasm.wat`)                                |
| `docs/`           | Extra notes                                                  |

## Notes

- The codebase uses Russian-language identifiers (Cyrillic variable and function names), inherited from the original source and preserved intentionally
- The extension requires the `management` permission to detect whether FFZ/BTTV are installed so it can inject the right scripts without conflicts
